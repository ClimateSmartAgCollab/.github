# Climate Smart Ag GitHub Collaboration

Climate-Smart Agriculture and Food Systems Initiative is funded by Genome Canada and works with research teams who seek solutions aimed at minimizing the impact of agricultural practices on the climate. Read more about this work on our public webpage ([English version](https://climatesmartagrifood.ca/) and [French version](https://agrintelligenteclimat.ca/)).

Within this GitHub organization we are supporting the work of our researchers for data harmonization, education and training, data governance, and standard development.

Read our helpful and instructive [English documentation](https://climatesmartagcollab.github.io/Documentation-en/)(en) and [French documentation](https://climatesmartagcollab.github.io/Documentation-fr/), hosted here in GitHub and providing data management training.

Look at the [schema library](https://climatesmartagcollab.github.io/HUB-Harmonization/) to learn what data your colleagues are collecting and to [add your own data schemas](https://climatesmartagcollab.github.io/Documentation-en/Data_Documentation/semantic_engine.html) to the search.

Log in with your GitHub account and then participate in [discussions](https://github.com/orgs/ClimateSmartAgCollab/discussions) to connect with other ICT groups and the Data Hub team. You must be a member of this GitHub organization to see the discussions.

# First steps
* Bookmark the [learning site](https://climatesmartagcollab.github.io/Documentation/) which will be continually updated with new information.
* Participate in a [discussion](https://github.com/orgs/ClimateSmartAgCollab/discussions), ask your colleagues questions, request help with data schemas. You must be a member of this GitHub organization to see the discussions.
* Document data you are generating using the [Semantic Engine](https://www.semanticengine.org). Publish these schemas in the [Schema library](https://climatesmartagcollab.github.io/HUB-Harmonization/).
* Discover what data other teams are collecting - browse the [Schema library](https://climatesmartagcollab.github.io/HUB-Harmonization/).
* See an opportunity for similar data collection? Add it to the [discussions](https://github.com/orgs/ClimateSmartAgCollab/discussions). The Data Hub will help with data standards development.
* New standards will be supported by the [Data Harmonizer](https://github.com/cidgoh/DataHarmonizer) in the future as they are developed.
