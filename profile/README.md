Climate Smart Ag GitHub Collaboration

Climate-Smart Agriculture and Food Systems Initiative is funded by Genome Canada and works with research teams who seek solutions aimed at minimizing the impact of agricultural practices on the climate. Read more about this work on our public webpage ([English version](https://climatesmartagrifood.ca/) and [French version](https://agrintelligenteclimat.ca/)).

Within this GitHub organization we are supporting the work of our researchers for data harmonization, education and training, data governance, and standard development.
